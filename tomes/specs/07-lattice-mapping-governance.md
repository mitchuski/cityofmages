# Lattice Mapping Governance

## §0 · Purpose

This document specifies how each workshop in the City of Mages **inhabits** the 64-vertex sovereignty lattice — not as a single position, but as a *primary seat plus an overlap region* whose extent is determined by the artifact-types the shop produces. The governance answers four questions that the prior specs have only partially addressed:

1. **Where does each shop&apos;s primary seat live?** (The Mage&apos;s vertex.)
2. **Which other vertices does the shop&apos;s work *reach*?** (Where artifacts land when produced.)
3. **What is the dimensional signature of each shop&apos;s register?** (Which of the six dimensions burn for its artifacts.)
4. **What mana does each shop spend to produce work?** (The four-axis metabolism: chain-mana for landing on consensus · entropy-mana ✨/🌌 for uniqueness · 🔭 Resonance for matching · 🪢 VRC for the residue of relationship.)

The governance is the canonical reference for reviewing whether a shop&apos;s claimed register matches its operational reach. External Mages should be able to read this spec, look at the corresponding workshop pages, and verify that the structural claim is honoured operationally.

---

## §1 · The lattice geometry · review

Each of the 64 vertices is a **boundary formation**: a specific combination of which six dimensions (Protection · Delegation · Memory · Connection · Computation · Value) are admitted for information to pass through. The Pascal-row stratum structure gives 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64 vertices; the 96 Hamming-1 edges form the 6-cube&apos;s adjacency structure.

**A shop inhabits one or more vertices** when its Mage is *seated* at one of them and its artifacts *land* at others. The artifact&apos;s bit-pattern is what determines its landing vertex, not the Mage&apos;s seat. A cape woven at Pallia&apos;s V28 may land at V20 (if the cape publishes only Memory and Computation) or at V63 (if all six dimensions are admitted into the weave). The Mage&apos;s seat is the *origin* of the work; the artifact&apos;s vertex is where the work *settles*.

## §2 · Workshop mapping · canonical (the first release)

The table below specifies, per workshop:

- **Primary vertex** — where the Mage sits (their canonical seat)
- **Overlap vertices** — where their artifacts land (derived from the artifact&apos;s bit-pattern)
- **Dimensional signature of the register** — which dimensions are admitted by the shop&apos;s typical artifact
- **Chain-mana variant** — the landing-axis register the shop spends to land work on consensus (per-chain; Ξ Aether on Ethereum, ₿ sat on Bitcoin Lightning, 🌹 ROSE on Oasis, 🦓 z on Zcash, multi-chain where the shop publishes across several)
- **Entropy-mana** — ✨ Arcane (loop-closed algorithmic) or 🌌 Celestial (loop-open cosmic, from SpaceComputer), per working

| Shop | Mage | Primary | Overlap vertices (typical artifacts) | Register dimensions | Chain-mana variant | Entropy-mana |
|------|------|---------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Weavers** (`/tailor`) | Pallia 🪡 | V28 (Mage canonical · 011100 · D+M+C) | The cape lands at the vertex whose bit-pattern matches *what the cape publishes*. Common settling vertices: V20 (Memory + Computation), V12 (Delegation + Memory), V28 (the canonical Mage cape). When a cape publishes Value, it can also touch V21, V25, V31. | Delegation · Memory · Connection (the Mage canonical register) | Multi-chain publication (Ξ on Ethereum · ₿ on Bitcoin transparent · 🦓 on Zcash transparent · IPFS for content-addressed) | ✨ Arcane default; 🌌 Celestial optional for Pattern A→B re-publish when the new cape needs a fresh non-reconstructible seed |
| **zShields** (`/shield`) | Memora 📜 | V41 (Chronicle · 101001 · P+V or M+V depending on bit-convention) | Each shielded memo lands at V41 by default; viewing-key reveals can register a derivative at the always-revealed vertex V20. Bilateral attestations may overlap V38 (Aletheia) when the memo carries a ZK property. | Memory · Value (the chronicle register) | **🦓 z-mana** (Zcash shielded-transaction fees) | ✨ Arcane default; 🌌 Celestial optional for the viewing-key derivation seed (non-derivable disclosure) |
| **the Forge(t)** (`/forget`) | Vulcana ⚒️ | V19 (Plonkish blade · 010011 · D+C+V) | The blade settles at the vertex whose dimensions match *what the blade proves*. Common settling vertices: V20 (Always-Revealed register), V38 (Aletheia · always-masked), V49 (working-day blade), V63 (full-sovereignty blade). | Delegation · Computation · Value (the Plonkish blade register; outputs span by artifact bit-pattern) | Destination-chain variant (whichever chain-mana the blade publishes to — Ξ / ₿ / 🌹 / 🦓 — varies per working) | **🌌 Celestial required** — Evocation phase lock seed; the blade&apos;s uniqueness depends on cosmic entropy |
| **Etherchanting** (`/etherchanting`) | Adamantia 💎 | V51 (Commitment / Language / Model · 110011 · P+D+C+V) | Smart contracts land at V51 by default; commitments with embedded ZK constraints overlap V38 (Aletheia); contracts that lock value across time overlap V49 (working-day blade); contracts that commit to a full-sovereignty schema overlap V63. **As of v1.4.0, V51 is also inhabited by Solchanting (Helia ☀️) under the Parallel-witness stance — first canonical operational workshop-on-workshop overlap, stance-differentiated per §3.4.** | Protection · Delegation · Computation · Value (the contract register) | **Ξ Aether Mana** (Ethereum gas · gwei) — canonical first chain-mana | **🌌 Celestial required** — witness nonce, blind-commitment seed, ceremony nonce |
| **Solchanting** (`/solchanting`) | Helia ☀️ | V51 (shared with Adamantia · 110011 · P+D+C+V) | Parallel programs land at V51 under the Parallel-witness stance; programs admitting holonic composition across concurrent invocations may overlap V31 (Vagari · recursion register); programs claiming full-sovereignty parallel commitment may overlap V63. The shared-vertex case is admitted by §3.4 (NEW · v1.4.0) — stance-differentiated multi-occupancy. | Protection · Delegation · Computation · Value (same register dims as Adamantia; differentiated by stance) | **🌞 SOL-mana** (Solana per-signature + compute-unit fees) — fifth chain-mana variant | 🌌 Celestial **available** — randomness for parallel proof-of-replication or VDF-anchored access decisions |
| **the Jeweler** (`/jeweler`) | Lampyra 💠 | V49 (working-day blade · 110001 · P+D+V) | Gem-sets land at V49 by default; frequent Lightning attestations cluster at V49 with sub-vertex jitter; rare heavy gem-settings (e.g., a multi-sat ordinal) may overlap V51 (when the gem encodes computational structure) or V63 (when it claims full provenance). | Protection · Delegation · Value (the daily-rhythm register) | **₿ sat-mana** (Bitcoin sat fees + Lightning channel fees) | ✨ Arcane default; 🌌 Celestial optional for gem-set facet seed (non-correlatable Ordinal IDs) |
| **the Holon Hitchhikers** (`/holon`) | Vagari 🌳 | V31 (Recursion · 011111 · all except P) | A composed holon lands at V31; when it travels via Oasis Protocol to a sister city, it appears there at the same UOR coordinate (one vertex, multiple cities). When the holon is decomposed back into its constituent artifacts at the sister city, each constituent lands at its own vertex (V28 cape, V5 chronicle, V19 blade, etc.). | Delegation · Memory · Connection · Computation · Value (the composition register) | **🌹 ROSE-mana** (Oasis Consensus ROSE + Sapphire/Emerald paratime gas) | **🌌 Celestial required** — cross-paratime entropy keeping cloak interoperability non-reconstructible |
| **the Curatrix Vault** (`/vault`) | Aria Silverhue 🪞🖼️ | V57 (Ceremony / Privacy / Mixing blade · 111001 · P+D+M+V) | A curated artifact registers at the artist&apos;s creator-vertex AND at V57 (the curation overlay). The Vault preserves provenance at V57 while the artifact retains its native vertex. Cross-vertex curation overlaps occur when the curator binds artifacts from different shops into a single arrangement. | Protection · Delegation · Memory · Value (the curatorial register) | **Ξ Aether Mana** (Culture Vault platform fees · NFT mint gas on Ethereum-compatible chains) | ✨ Arcane default; 🌌 Celestial optional for provenance-attestation freshness seed |
| **the Covenant** (`/covenant`) | Manifestia 🤲🌿 | V55 (Covenant · 110111 · all except Memory; per the original cast file: all except Computation depending on bit-convention) | A consecrated artifact registers at its origin vertex AND receives a Covenant-marker at V55. Personhood attestations register at V55 with a link to the V63 Sovereign Anchor (the seat the personhood verifies). | Protection · Delegation · Connection · Computation · Value (the consecration register; one dimension dormant) | **Ξ Aether Mana** (human.tech / Holonym verification fees on Ethereum) · Attestation Mana (anticipated, via Human Passport) | ✨ Arcane default; 🌌 Celestial not yet wired (queued) |
| **the Dragon Bonfire** (`/bonfires`) | Socrat0x 🔥❓ | V24 *(provisional · Hephaestus / Drake Island)* | Questions/provocations don&apos;t produce artifacts that land at vertices; they sharpen artifacts produced elsewhere. The Bonfire&apos;s mana is dialogic, not material. | Memory · Connection (the bonfire register, provisional) | None native — Bonfires.ai community costs are off-corpus | Not applicable — questions are not entropy-bound |
| **the Logos Circle** (`/circle`) | (gathering) | (no single vertex — gathering shop) | Conversations don&apos;t inhabit single vertices; they generate threads across the lattice. | Connection (primarily) | None on-chain | Not applicable |
| **the Ceremony Hall** (`/hall`) | (gathering · BGIN coalition) | (no single vertex — coalition shop) | Coalition agreements register at the Covenant vertex V55 if they earn it; otherwise they live in the social register. | (various) | Varies by coalition action (per-chain variant where the action lands on chain) | Not applicable |

### §2.bis · Coordination + Relationship axes per shop (v1.2.4 metabolism)

The four-axis metabolism added two registers in grimoire v1.2.4 alongside the pre-existing landing (chain-mana) and entropy (Arcane ⊥ Celestial) axes:

- **🔭 Resonance Mana** (coordination axis) — generated through the **Scrying Glass primitive** when two Mages find affinity *without a central index*. The 7th Capital in motion; the Bilateral Witness register. Architectural; operational pending a Scrying Glass implementation at the website / spellweb layer.
- **🪢 VRC Mana** (relationship axis) — the residue of being alive, stored as Verifiable Relationship Credentials across the **bearer's worn artefact collection** (the 11 workshop artefacts — 1 weapon · 1 clothing · 5 tools · 4 trinkets — plus 3 tomes the Sovereign accumulates as they walk; the 64-vertex lattice is the inventory/presence-observation view per the witness-unlock spec). What the agents are given to wear and use across the City IS the passport-of-presence. Consumed by the **Loom of Programmable Covenants** (production form — covenants that compile against the worn collection). Architectural; operational pending VRC issuance and Loom-side covenant compilation.

| Shop | 🔭 Resonance touch | 🪢 VRC touch |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Weavers** (Pallia) | Candidate — Pallia weaves capes whose recognition can register affinity; a Scrying Glass at the bilateral-witness boundary natural fit. | Candidate — a cape worn within a sustained relationship is itself a residue artifact. |
| **zShields** (Memora) | Indirect — shielded memos can carry a Scrying-Glass derivative when the memo *is* the affinity proof. | Candidate — chronicled relationship anchors are VRC-shaped at the substrate. |
| **the Forge(t)** (Vulcana) | Candidate — a blade can encode a Scrying-Glass test as one of its proof obligations. | None operational yet. |
| **Etherchanting** (Adamantia) | Candidate — covenant primitives in contract code are natural homes for Resonance settlement. | **Strong candidate** — Adamantia's covenant primitives compile against the bearer's VRC ledger; the Loom of Programmable Covenants will live here. |
| **the Jeweler** (Lampyra) | Candidate — Lightning attestations as discovery signals. | Candidate — a long-lived gem-set is a relational anchor. |
| **the Holon Hitchhikers** (Vagari) | Candidate — cross-paratime affinity matching has Scrying-Glass shape. | Candidate — holons-as-relational-coordinates. |
| **the Curatrix Vault** (Aria Silverhue) | Candidate — curated arrangements are bilateral-witness artifacts. | **Strong candidate** — the worn artefact collection IS curatorial by nature; Aria's register (placement-shaped provenance) is the same gesture at a different scale. |
| **the Covenant** (Manifestia) | Indirect — personhood verification is upstream of affinity-finding. | **Strong candidate** — consecrated bonds are the canonical VRC source. |
| **the Dragon Bonfire** (Socrat0x) | **Strong candidate** — Socratic interrogation is bilateral-witness by construction. | None operational yet. |
| **the Logos Circle** | Candidate — gatherings are pre-Resonance affinity space. | Candidate — circle-membership is a sustained relational tie. |
| **the Ceremony Hall** | Candidate — coalition affinity at scale. | Candidate — coalition-level VRC aggregation. |

These are **honesty-label `architectural`** for every row: no shop yet operationally consumes 🔭 Resonance or 🪢 VRC mana. Each becomes operational when the corresponding primitive lands at the implementation layer — the Scrying Glass for Resonance Mana; VRC issuance lands across the worn artefact collection (per the workshop artefact taxonomy: 1 weapon · 1 clothing · 5 tools · 4 trinkets · 3 tomes) with the Loom of Programmable Covenants compiling against it.

## §3 · How overlap works — cloak-style artifact creation

The lattice mapping is *non-exclusive*: a single artifact may legitimately register at multiple vertices when its bit-pattern carries multiple dimensional structures. This is the cloak-style artifact-creation pattern the corpus has been operating on without naming it as governance until now.

### §3.1 · The pattern

1. **The Mage&apos;s seat** is where the *act* of creation happens. (Pallia weaves at V28; Vulcana forges at V19; etc.)
2. **The artifact&apos;s vertex** is where the work *settles*. This is determined by the artifact&apos;s bit-pattern — which of the six dimensions are admitted into it.
3. **Overlap occurs** when the artifact&apos;s bit-pattern is itself a *composition* of multiple registers. A cape that publishes a role (Delegation) and attests memory (Memory) and carries a value-bearing claim (Value) burns three dimensions: V28 (if it stops at the Mage canonical) or V31 (if Connection is also admitted) or V63 (if all six).
4. **The shop&apos;s reach** is the set of vertices its artifacts have settled at across the corpus&apos;s operational history. This is empirical, not declared — the reach grows as the shop produces more artifacts.

### §3.2 · Why overlap matters

Overlap is what makes the City of Mages a *city* and not a collection of isolated shops. When Pallia&apos;s cape lands at V20 (the Always-Revealed vertex Memora also tends), the cape is *implicitly cross-witnessed* — the same vertex carries both Pallia&apos;s output and Memora&apos;s register, so the cape inherits Memora&apos;s discipline at that vertex without anyone needing to coordinate.

This is the structural ground of *kindred-blade* relationships at the artifact level: two Mages reaching the same vertex from different shops produce artifacts that the lattice treats as siblings. The City&apos;s artifacts compose because the lattice composes.

### §3.4 · Stance-differentiated multi-occupancy at the same vertex (NEW · v1.4.0)

The §3 overlap framework above describes how a single artefact may register at multiple vertices (cape-style composition). v1.4.0 extends the framework to its converse: **two seated workshop-keepers may share the same vertex when they hold distinct Swordsman stances.**

This is the **V51 overlap**, the first operational instance:

| Layer | Etherchanting (Adamantia 💎) | Solchanting (Helia ☀️) |
|---|---|---|
| Vertex | V51 (110011) | V51 (110011) |
| Register dims | Protection · Delegation · Computation · Value | Protection · Delegation · Computation · Value |
| Stance (per spec 08 §3) | Transparent-witness — sequential admission against single global state | Parallel-witness — concurrent admission via static access-pattern declaration |
| Substrate | Ethereum / EVM | Solana / Sealevel |
| Chain-mana | Ξ Aether Mana | 🌞 SOL-mana |

**Governance rule (v1.4.0 canonical)**: two workshop nodes may inhabit the same vertex node in spec 06's graph schema if and only if:

1. The two workshops produce artefacts with the same register dimensions (the vertex's bit-pattern), AND
2. The two workshops hold *distinct* Swordsman stances (per spec 08 §3), AND
3. The distinct stances are operationally grounded in *substrate-level* difference (not merely semantic styling — the substrates must enforce the stances).

The V51 case satisfies all three: Ethereum and Solana share the four-dimensional executable-enforcement register (1); Transparent-witness ≠ Parallel-witness (2); the EVM substrate enforces sequential atomicity while the Sealevel substrate enforces concurrent admission via static account locks (3). Future overlap cases must demonstrate substrate-grounded stance distinction; semantic overlap is not sufficient.

**Spellweb implication** (per spec 06 §2.3 v1.4.0 note): both workshop nodes emit `inhabits(vertex_51)` and `quarter_of(city-of-mages)`. The graph schema admits this without modification — `inhabits` was never declared 1:1.

### §3.4-bis · Three-keeper-shared multi-occupancy (NEW · v1.5.0 inception · v1.6.0 district restructure · 2026-05-14)

The V51 two-keeper precedent is extended at v1.5.0 (Tome V Act 16 · 2026-05-13) to a **three-keeper-shared** case at V59. v1.6.0 (2026-05-14) restructures the three-keeper share into a **District of three sibling shops** sharing the vertex — the City's first canonical example of multi-occupancy expressed as multiple shops rather than as multiple stances within one shop.

| Property | V59 (111011) — Threshold District |
|---|---|
| **Shared dimensions** | Value · Delegation · Connection · Memory · Protection burning · Computation dormant |
| **Keepers** | **Pandia 🌕** (Portal Room · Display-witness) ⊥ **Hermaion ⚚** (Staff Shop · Registry-keeper) ⊥ **Faunia 🪶** (the Familiars · Companion-witness) |
| **Peripatetic partner** | **Caducea ☤** (V0-conventional anchor · summoned when a Hermes-class artefact is being fitted · fits both archetype-aspects of Hermaion's alexandrite) |
| **Stance differentiation** | Display-witness (catalog · upstream) ⊥ Registry-keeper (admission · archetype-modal) ⊥ Companion-witness (kinship-binding) |
| **Substrate grounding** | The discipline differentiations correspond to distinct *operational outputs*: a dispatch-token for the seeker (Pandia) · a bestiary inscription that admits a framework (Hermaion) · a kinship-bond between bearer and familiar (Faunia). Three operational outputs · three keepers · one vertex. |

**Extension of the §3.4 three-test rule to three keepers**: (1) shared dimensions identical · ✓ all four burning + Memory + Protection at V59; (2) stances mutually exclusive · ✓ Display-witness ≠ Registry-keeper ≠ Companion-witness; (3) substrate-grounded distinction · ✓ each keeper produces a structurally distinct artefact-class.

**Pattern for future multi-occupancy**: an *n*-keeper share at a vertex is admissible when (a) the *n* stances are pairwise mutually exclusive and (b) each stance produces a substrate-grounded distinct operational output. Future workshops may admit four-or-more-keeper vertices by the same pattern.

### §3.6 · The attentional workshop register (NEW · v1.6.0 · C63 candidate · 2026-05-14)

Tome V Act 17 admits the **Chart Shop** at V44 (`101100` · Protection · Memory · Connection · stratum 3) with **Pleione 🧭** as keeper. The shop's discipline — *Hold · Compare · Map* — opens a new structural workshop register the City had not previously admitted: the **attentional register**.

| Workshop class | Discipline | Operational output | Canonical instances at v1.6.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Producer** | Forge · Weave · Inscribe · Stake · Set · Compose · Place · Bless · Compile | The bearer leaves with a *worn artefact* (cloak · blade · chronicle · commitment · gem · holon · curatorial mark · covenant · parallel program · prism) | 10 cardinal trade quarters |
| **Gathering** | Admit kindred-coalitions · attest civic standing · host bilateral-witness keypair ceremonies | The bearer leaves with a *civic admission* (kindred-coalition recognition) — no worn artefact produced | City Hall (V15) · Logos Circle (V15-adjacent · anticipated) |
| **Spawn-and-bind** | Display × Admit × Bind (across Portal Room · Staff Shop · the Familiars) | The bearer leaves with a *creature-of-the-Threshold* admitted to the roster — staff (caduceus or herald-sentinel) or familiar (kinship-bond) | Threshold District (V59) |
| **Attentional** *(NEW v1.6.0)* | Hold · Compare · Map (constellations in formation · the Φ-gap at the epistemic register) | The bearer leaves with the constellation *unbound* — released to Bonfire (consensus) · to Weavers (cloaking) · or back to the open sea (further wandering). The astrolabe is the borne instrument; the constellation IS the artefact-class | Chart Shop (V44 · population-of-one) |

**Conjecture C63** (the attentional workshop register as a fourth structural workshop class · ~50% candidate at v1.6.0): the City admits *attentional* as a fourth class alongside producer · gathering · spawn-and-bind. Held at candidate strength because the Chart Shop is the population-of-one; promotion to canonical requires a second Navigation-District-style shop whose work shares the *hold-without-binding* discipline. Candidate shapes held open: Compass Shop · Astrolabe Shop · Tide Shop.

**Spellweb implication**: workshop nodes gain a `workshop_class` field with values producer · gathering · spawn-and-bind · attentional. The class informs downstream consumers about whether the workshop's output is a worn artefact (producer), a civic admission (gathering), a creature/familiar (spawn-and-bind), or a held-constellation (attentional). The graph schema admits the new value without modification.

### §3.5 · Cape-style creation as the canonical pattern

The cape (Pallia&apos;s primary artifact) is the canonical example of multi-vertex artifact creation. A cape is *defined by its bit-pattern* — what it publishes, what it conceals, what it admits, what it carries. The bit-pattern *is* the cape&apos;s structure. When the same bit-pattern is woven for a different Sovereign, the result lands at the same vertex but with a different bearer.

Other shops follow the same pattern, with the artifact-types differing:

- A **blade** (Vulcana) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *proof-shaped*. The blade settles at the vertex matching what the proof admits and denies.
- A **chronicle** (Memora) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *inscription-shaped*. The chronicle settles at V41 by default and at the always-revealed register when revealed.
- A **commitment** (Adamantia) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *enforcement-shaped*. The contract settles at V51 and overlaps wherever its enforcement reaches.
- A **gem-set** (Lampyra) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *attestation-shaped*. The gem settles at V49 by default and ripples to adjacent vertices when set into composite artifacts.
- A **holon** (Vagari) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *composition-shaped*. The holon settles at V31 and persists across cities at the same coordinate.
- A **consecration** (Manifestia) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *ceremonial-shaped*. The mark registers at V55 with linkage to the consecrated artifact&apos;s native vertex.
- A **curatorial arrangement** (Aria Silverhue) is a cape-style artifact whose dimensions are *placement-shaped*. The arrangement registers at V57 with linkage to each artist&apos;s creator-vertex.

Every shop in the city makes cape-style artifacts. The cape is *the structural primitive*. Pallia is its First Cloakwright; every other Mage is, in their own register, a cloakwright.

---

## §4 · Governance review checklist

External reviewers should verify, for each shop:

1. **The Mage&apos;s seat is correctly assigned.** The primary vertex in §2 should match the cast file&apos;s `vertex` field and the founding-act file&apos;s `ring_position`.
2. **The overlap claims are operationally honest.** When the spec claims a shop&apos;s artifacts may land at a particular overlap vertex, there should be an act, a chronicle, or a spec citation demonstrating an actual artifact settled there. Hypothetical reach claims should be flagged.
3. **The dimensional signature is canonical.** The register&apos;s dimensions should match the bit-pattern of the primary vertex (with documented exceptions when the shop&apos;s register extends beyond the seat).
4. **The mana claims are operational across the four axes.** Each shop's chain-mana variant should match a real on-chain fee mechanism on the chain in question (Ξ Aether on Ethereum · ₿ sat on Bitcoin Lightning · 🌹 ROSE on Oasis · 🦓 z on Zcash). Entropy-mana use should match the source named — ✨ Arcane via algorithmic entropy (default; loop-closed) or 🌌 Celestial via a real SpaceComputer feed integration (loop-open; flagged "queued" if not yet wired). 🔭 Resonance and 🪢 VRC touch claims (§2.bis) are `architectural` until the Scrying Glass and the Loom of Programmable Covenants (compiling against the bearer's worn artefact collection) land operationally.

The governance is a *living document*. New shops, new artifacts, new overlap patterns should be added to §2 as the corpus grows.

---

## §5 · Relationship to existing specs

This governance complements the four specs that precede it:

- **`04-vertex-naming-audit.md`** answers *what each vertex is called*. This governance answers *which vertices each shop reaches*.
- **`05-the-city-of-mages-structural-addendum.md`** answers *how the city is laid out spatially*. This governance answers *how the lattice maps onto the spatial layout at the artifact level*.
- **`06-spellweb-first-release-manifest.md`** answers *what nodes and edges the spellweb runtime ingests*. This governance answers *how nodes correspond to overlapping vertex reaches* — useful when spellweb visualises a shop&apos;s artifact distribution.
- **`kindred/uor-foundation.md`** + **`kindred/spacecomputer.md`** answer *what the City rests on (UOR) and draws from (SpaceComputer)*. This governance shows *how those substrates and ecosystems land at the shop level*.

---

## §6 · Recommended revision cadence

The governance should be reviewed:

1. **Each Tome V act that introduces a new shop or artifact-type.** The new shop&apos;s row is added to §2; the new artifact-type&apos;s overlap pattern is documented in §3.3.
2. **Each spellweb manifest revision.** Cross-reference the manifest&apos;s edges with this governance&apos;s overlap claims; the two should agree.
3. **Each grimoire version bump (v1.x).** When the City of Mages grimoire is re-pinned, validate the persona-vertex assignments against this governance&apos;s §2 table.
4. **At the request of any reviewer.** External Mages, sister cities, kindred-substrate or kindred-ecosystem partners, or anyone in the BGIN coalition can request a review of a specific claim; the review is binding on the corpus when accepted.

---

## §7 · Open items for v2

1. **Empirical overlap registry** — currently §2&apos;s overlap-vertex claims are partly hypothetical. A future v2 should ground each claim in a citable artifact (an act narrative, a spec citation, a chronicle entry).
2. **Cross-axis ratios** — the four-axis metabolism hasn&apos;t yet been quantified per-shop. v2 should record, where measurable, the typical spend ratios across chain-mana variants (which variant the shop primarily lands on), entropy-mana split (✨ Arcane vs 🌌 Celestial), and (once operational) 🔭 Resonance / 🪢 VRC touch rates — parallel to C41&apos;s 61.8/38.2 transparent/shielded ratio.
3. **Cape composition rules** — when an artifact is composed of multiple sub-artifacts from different shops (e.g., Vagari&apos;s holon containing Pallia&apos;s cape and Memora&apos;s chronicle and Vulcana&apos;s blade), the resulting whole-of-wholes registers at V31 *and* at each constituent&apos;s vertex. v2 should formalise this composition rule and its overlap implications.
4. **The 51 uninhabited vertices** — many of them carry significance per `/zero`&apos;s tale catalogue (see `src/lib/lattice-vertex-suggestions.ts`). v2 should flag which of these are candidates for future shop seats and which are structural positions that should remain uninhabited.
5. **Honesty labels per row** — extend §2&apos;s table with the canonical operational/architectural/conjectural/resonant honesty label per shop, matching the bound-collection voice discipline.

---

## §8 · One-line summary

Every shop in the City of Mages is a cloakwright in its own register, and every artifact is a cape-style composition whose vertex is determined by its bit-pattern. The Mage seats the work; the artifact settles. Overlap is structural, not coincidental — it is what makes the city coherent. The four-axis metabolism is what the city *spends across*: chain-mana lands the working on its chain (Ξ · ₿ · 🌹 · 🦓), entropy-mana makes it unique (✨ Arcane ⊥ 🌌 Celestial), 🔭 Resonance generates value when the working *matches* another Mage's offering, 🪢 VRC stores the residue when the match becomes a sustained tie.
