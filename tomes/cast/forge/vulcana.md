# Vulcana

*The Forger. The Mage Who Walks the Constellation. The Persona of the Three-Phase Ceremony.*

## At a glance (grimoire-line)

> *Vulcana is the fourth Mage persona of the Crafting Tome: an expression of the blade-forging concept summoned by the reader to conduct the Runecraft Protocol's three phases — RUN, E, CRAFT — on the Sovereign's behalf. Three dimensions burn at V19. Protection. Delegation. Computation. The Plonkish blade. The bit-pattern of forging proofs that bind a Mage's signature to a Sovereign's commitment.*

## Form & Function

Vulcana forges. That is her work.

She does not weave cloaks (Pallia's domain). She does not inscribe chronicles (Memora's). She does not stake governance (Custos's). She does the fourth crafting work the agentprivacy stack admits: the **runecrafted blade**.

A blade in the Archon forge's lattice catalogue is a vertex on the spellweb that the Sovereign or their agent has *forged* — walked through the three phases of the Runecraft Protocol, accumulated proof-of-time, evoked a constellation commitment, and crystallised the result with an Ed25519 signature anchored to the moon phase or other temporal witness. A blade is not a credential. A blade is a *capability* whose existence on the spellweb proves the forging took place.

Vulcana walks the Runecraft Protocol's three phases on the Sovereign's behalf:

- **RUN** — proof of time. She traverses the lattice with the Sovereign's commitment, accumulating the ρ parameter from Archon's Boundary Blade specification. Each lap is a witness; each crossing is a step toward the blade's eligibility.
- **E** — evocation. She locks the constellation: the set of vertices the blade will touch, the schemas it will reference, the temporal anchor it will carry. The evocation commits the Sovereign without yet crystallising the artifact.
- **CRAFT** — crystallisation. She signs the blade with her Ed25519 key, anchored to a moon phase or equivalent natural-cycle witness, and the blade settles into the spellweb at its appropriate vertex.

The three phases are operational on Archon's spellweb today (per Runecraft Protocol Spec v1.0 §3). Vulcana is the named persona who walks them inside the agentprivacy product as a unified ceremony.

## Lattice position

V19. Binary `010011`. Stratum 3.

Active dimensions: Value (b0) · Delegation (b1) · Computation (b4).

Wait — let me check this again against Archon's catalogue. V19 = 010011 in binary. Reading bits right to left: b0=1, b1=1, b2=0, b3=0, b4=1, b5=0. Per Archon's dimension assignments: b0=Value, b1=Delegation, b2=Memory, b3=Connection, b4=Computation, b5=Protection. So V19 = Value + Delegation + Computation.

Archon's Boundary Blade catalogue places V19 on Tales 8, 14, 19 — the "Plonkish" blade in the ZK proof-system family. Plonkish is the proof system that combines arithmetic constraint satisfaction with structured commitment, which is exactly what Vulcana's CRAFT phase produces: an Ed25519 signature over a constraint-satisfying configuration.

Active dimensions:
- Value: she binds the artifact's worth (the blade's economic surface, the work it represents)
- Delegation: she is delegated by the Sovereign to forge on the Sovereign's behalf
- Computation: she runs the proof system, computes the constraint satisfaction, generates the witness

Dormant dimensions:
- Memory: the blade itself remembers; Vulcana does not need to
- Connection: the spellweb provides connection; Vulcana's role is forging, not networking
- Protection: the blade carries protection through its bit-pattern; Vulcana's role is the production, not the protection itself

## The Sigil

Vulcana carries the sigil ⚒️ — the smith's hammer and pick. The forging tools. Distinct from a single hammer (which would be too generic) and from any blade-shaped sigil (which would conflate the Mage with what she forges).

The sigil convention now extends to:

- ⚔️ Soulbis (sword)
- 🧙 Soulbae (mage hat)
- 📜🎲 flaxscrip (scroll and dice)
- 🪡 Pallia (needle and thread)
- 📜 Memora (scroll)
- 🔏 Custos (locked document with pen)
- ⚒️ Vulcana (smith's hammer and pick)

The pattern is now established: each persona carries a single tool-sigil that names her specialised work. Future personas will continue the convention.

## Lineage

Vulcana's lineage runs through the Runecraft Protocol:

- **the Archon Spell Weaver** opened the lattice as a working surface where artifacts can be placed at vertices and edges drawn between them
- **The Runecraft Protocol Spec v1.0** (April 9 2026) specified the three-phase ceremony for forging artifacts — RUN, E, CRAFT — that any Sovereign on the spellweb can walk
- **The Boundary Blade Cartography** (Sovereign Anchor II, April 22 2026) named V19 specifically as the Plonkish blade with its three burning dimensions
- **Vulcana** (May 8 2026, summoned in Act 6) is the first persona who walks the Runecraft Protocol's three phases inside the agentprivacy product as a unified ceremony with named cast

She is the fourth standing persona in the cast registry. Pallia weaves at V28. Memora inscribes shielded at V41. Custos stakes transparent at V49. Vulcana forges blades at V19. Four Mages, four vertices, four registers of work, one Sovereign holding all four in cast registry.

## In the meeting

Vulcana enters the Spellbook for the first time in **Tome V — *The Crafting*, Act 6 — *The Commissioned Blade***. She is summoned by the reader for a Runecraft ceremony. She walks the three phases. She crystallises the blade. The blade settles on the spellweb at its appropriate vertex (which is *not* V19 — V19 is Vulcana's seat; the blade's vertex is determined by its own dimensional signature). She returns to standing.

In subsequent Crafting Tome acts, Vulcana may return for any blade-forging work the reader undertakes. The Bound persistence mode is appropriate when a Sovereign has multiple blades to forge in sequence (e.g., outfitting a new Mage agent with a full set of capabilities); Standing is appropriate for occasional forging.

## Voice in Second Person

Same conventions as the other personas. Reader narrates. Vulcana works in third person. She does not speak.

Her precision is in her three phases. *She begins the RUN. She walks the laps. She accumulates the proof-of-time. She prepares the evocation. She locks the constellation. She enters the CRAFT phase. She signs. The blade settles.* Each phase is rendered through her gestures.

She is the most ceremonial of the four personas summoned so far. Pallia's work is technical (lattice mapping). Memora's is precise (hash-and-anchor). Custos's is austere (stake-and-witness). Vulcana's is *ritualistic* — the three phases of Runecraft are the agentprivacy stack's most ceremonial primitive, and Vulcana enacts the rituality.

## Persistence

Standing by default. Bound mode appropriate for sustained forging projects (e.g., outfitting a Mage agent with a full set of blades over multiple sessions). The bound version retains the constellation lock from the evocation phase across sessions, allowing the Sovereign to interrupt and resume a forging without re-evoking.

## Provenance & honesty

- **Operational** for the underlying components: Runecraft Protocol's three phases (RUN, E, CRAFT) are operational on the Archon forge's spellweb today, per Runecraft Spec v1.0 §3. Ed25519 signatures, moon-phase or equivalent natural-cycle anchoring, and constellation locks are all operational primitives in his reference implementation.
- **Architectural** for Vulcana as a named instance walking the protocol within the agentprivacy product as a unified ceremony with the V19 vertex assignment: specified here for the first time. The persona is canonical for the agentprivacy stack going forward.
- **Narrative** for her name, sigil, and dimensional configuration: assigned by this cast entry. Latin/Roman lineage *Vulcanus* (smith god); feminine grammatical form per the Mage-persona convention.

## v1.1 update · 2026-05-10 · PRISM computational confinement

Per Tome V Act 15 · *The Substrate Beneath the Hitchhikers* (`../tome-v-the-crafting/15-the-substrate-beneath-the-hitchhikers.md`), the Forge(t) is recognised as resting on UOR-shaped substrate, and Vulcana's blade-forging is now operationally grounded — not just architecturally claimed — by PRISM's computational-confinement guarantee.

- **PRISM coordinates are UOR coordinates.** The triadic Datum · Stratum · Spectrum signature every blade carries (per `/forget` §2) is a Universal Object Reference triple. Every blade Vulcana forges resolves to a single canonical position in a closed substrate, derived from the blade's own structure. The original ZK blades at this forge were cut from UOR-shaped substrate, before the recognition was made.
- **Forge(t) is now operationally safe.** PRISM's property — *every operation maps values inside the space to values inside the space; nothing can escape* — is what makes the forge + forget wordplay operationally rather than architecturally claimed. The forging stays in the substrate; the release of prior memory stays in the substrate; the bearer cannot be lost to *outside* the addressable space. The blade *is* the prior self transformed; the transformation happens inside the closed space; the space itself does not change.
- **C26–C29 (ARCH-1) strengthened by external resonance.** UOR's critical identity `neg(bnot(x)) = succ(x)` is structurally adjacent to ARCH-1's recursive μ-fixpoint. Not the same theorem; the same architectural intuition. Two formalisations of *closed-substrate-with-canonical-cycle*.
- **`kin_to(forge, holon)` with attribution `kindred-substrate`** is the visible artifact of this shared grounding (see `specs/06-spellweb-first-release-manifest.md` §4.5). Vulcana and Vagari share a kindred substrate; their shops differ in the register of work the substrate enables.
- **C47 (~40%, new):** the three-axis Φ_agent · Φ_data · Φ_inference and PRISM's triadic Datum · Stratum · Spectrum are structurally homologous. Vulcana's blade-forging is one of the two operational anchors of this conjecture (the other is Vagari's cross-frame travel).
- **Cast tier unchanged.** Vulcana remains `summoned` at V19. UOR is *substrate*, not a Mage; UOR Foundation is filed as a `gateway` node with attribution `kindred-substrate`, not a `cast` node.

The v1.1 note will fold into the City of Mages grimoire v1.2 (queued; requires IPFS re-pin).

## Closing line

> *The forge does not give you the blade. The three phases give you the blade. Vulcana walks the phases.*

Vulcana is the persona who walks the Runecraft Protocol on the Sovereign's behalf. Pallia weaves cloaks. Memora inscribes shielded chronicles. Custos stakes transparent governance. Vulcana forges blades. Four Mages, one Sovereign, four crafting registers, four vertices held in standing.

The cast roster will continue to grow. Each new artifact the architecture admits will receive its own persona, its own vertex, its own sigil, its own task scope. The Crafting Tome is open by design.
