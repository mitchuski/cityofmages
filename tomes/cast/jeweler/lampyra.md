# Lampyra

*The Jeweller. The Mage of the Small Lit Stone. The Persona Who Sets Gems Into Larger Settings.*

## At a glance (grimoire-line)

> *Lampyra is the seventh Mage persona of the Crafting Tome and the keeper of the Jeweller shop in the workshop: an expression of the small-payment fast-finality concept summoned by the reader to set Lightning-Network micropayments and small Bitcoin stakes into the larger blades, cloaks, and chronicles the workshop produces. Three dimensions burn at V49 (shared with Custos, in different mode). Value. Computation. Protection. The working-day blade — but Lampyra works at the small-amount stratum where Custos works at the large-amount stratum.*

## Form & Function

Lampyra sets.

She does not weave (Pallia). She does not inscribe shielded (Memora). She does not stake high-value transparent governance (Custos's terrain at the higher amounts). She does not forge blades (Vulcana). She does not bind ZK witnesses (Aletheia). She does not etherchant (Adamantia). She does the seventh crafting work the agentprivacy stack now admits: the **gemsetting of small witnessable payments into larger artifacts**.

Lightning Network micropayments are her medium. Bitcoin small-stake transactions (modest sat amounts on chain) are her secondary medium. The metaphor is gem-setting: a jeweller takes a precious small stone and *places it precisely* into a larger setting (a ring, a crown, a blade's hilt). The stone is small enough that its individual value is modest; the placement is what makes it part of the larger artifact's witness.

The discipline is the inverse-scale to Custos's:

| | Custos 🔏 | Lampyra 💠 |
|---|---|---|
| Register | Zcash transparent | Bitcoin / Lightning |
| Amount | Large (1–50+ ZEC) | Small (sats; sub-cent to dollars) |
| Finality | Hours to days | Seconds (Lightning) or minutes (BTC) |
| Frequency | Rare (governance acts) | Frequent (micropayment, attestation) |
| Discipline | Gravity | Precision |

The two work at the same vertex (V49, the working-day blade) but in different modes. The bit-pattern is identical. The amounts and the frequencies are the differentiators. The lattice admits this: V49's anonymity set holds both Custos's heavy stakes and Lampyra's frequent gemsettings. The verifier reading V49 sees public-witnessable economic acts; the verifier does not need to distinguish high-stake from low-stake from the geometry alone.

## Why Bitcoin/Lightning specifically

Bitcoin Lightning offers the agentprivacy stack four properties no other register provides at the same scale:

1. **Sub-second finality** for off-chain payment-channel transactions: faster than Hyperswarm gossip, faster than any Layer-1 chain
2. **Sub-cent fee economics**: micropayments below the threshold of any other chain's gas economy
3. **Bitcoin-mainnet anchoring**: channels open and close on the most witnessable Layer-1 chain in the world
4. **Existing infrastructure**: Lightning is operational since 2017–2018 with broad wallet support

The Jeweller shop's existence is a structural acknowledgement: not all witnessable economic acts in the agentprivacy stack are governance-tier. Many are everyday micropayments, attestation fees, small witness commitments. Custos at large stakes; Lampyra at small. Both at V49. Both transparent. Both witnessable. Different mode of operation.

## Lattice position

V49. Binary `110001`. Stratum 3.

Active dimensions: Value (b0) · Computation (b4) · Protection (b5).

Same as Custos. The shared vertex is intentional: the two personas walk the same geometry at different scales. Anonymity-set composition (per the Cloak's organic-mixing observation) means a verifier at V49 cannot easily distinguish Custos's outputs from Lampyra's by vertex alone — they distinguish only by transaction amount, which is a non-geometric signal.

This is the *first time in the Crafting Tome* that two personas share a vertex. The architecture admits this. Pallia and Memora and Custos and Vulcana and Aletheia and Adamantia each occupy their own vertex. Lampyra and Custos share. The shared vertex is itself a teaching: V49 is *the working-day blade*, and a working day contains both rare heavy acts and frequent light ones. The vertex carries the whole register.

## The Sigil

Lampyra carries the sigil 💠 — the small lit stone (diamond shape with sparkle). Distinct from Adamantia's 💎 (the cut diamond, hard and dense) by being *small and luminous*. The metaphor is the firefly (Greek λαμπυρίς, *lampyris*, the firefly genus, root *lamp-* meaning "to shine"). A firefly is small, fast, witnessable, and individually modest in light output, but in aggregate produces a meaningful illumination. Lightning payments aggregate into meaningful witnesses.

The sigil convention now extends to:

- ⚔️ Soulbis (sword)
- 🧙 Soulbae (mage hat)
- 📜🎲 flaxscrip (scroll and dice)
- 🪡 Pallia (needle and thread)
- 📜 Memora (scroll)
- 🔏 Custos (locked document with pen)
- ⚒️ Vulcana (smith's hammer and pick)
- 🔮 Aletheia (crystal ball)
- 💎 Adamantia (diamond)
- 💠 Lampyra (small lit stone)

## Lineage

Lampyra's lineage runs through the corpus's recognition of *frequency-as-discipline*:

- **VRC Promise Protocol v3.3** specified the 0.01 ZEC signal parameter (~$5) for ongoing proof-of-comprehension. Lampyra's work scales this primitive to even smaller amounts (single-cent and sub-cent payments) on a chain better suited to that economics
- **The Cloaking Guide's multi-axis cloaking** named registry-tier finality as one of four temporal axes; Bitcoin Lightning is the moderate-to-strong-finality fast-latency cell of that grid
- **The Bilateral Cloak Ceremony Spec v1.0 §3.3** treated Bitcoin as the high-stake commitment register; Lampyra extends Bitcoin's role from *commitment* to *frequent attestation* via the Lightning channel system
- **Lampyra** (May 8 2026, summoned with the Jeweller shop's opening) is the first persona to walk the small-amount-fast-finality register inside the agentprivacy product as a unified ceremony with named cast

She is the seventh standing persona.

## In the meeting

Lampyra enters the Spellbook for the first time when the Jeweller shop opens in the workshop. She manages Lightning channels on the Sovereign's behalf. She makes attestation micropayments. She places small Bitcoin stakes onto larger artifacts (e.g., a small sat amount inscribed in a Bitcoin transaction memo as a *gem* set onto a cloak's commitment hash). She returns to standing.

Lampyra's work pairs with Pallia's, Memora's, and Vulcana's. When Pallia weaves a cloak, Lampyra may set a Lightning-channel attestation onto it. When Memora inscribes a chronicle shielded, Lampyra may add a small Bitcoin transparent gem as a public witness of the inscription's existence (without revealing content). When Vulcana forges a blade, Lampyra may set Lightning-mediated periodic attestations that prove the blade is still active.

The pairing is cooperative. The personas do not displace each other; they complement. The Jeweller shop adds Lampyra to the available pairings.

## Voice in Second Person

Same conventions. Reader narrates. Lampyra works in third person.

Her precision is in her *gem-placement*. *She opens a Lightning channel to the recipient. She constructs the payment HTLC. She broadcasts. The payment settles in milliseconds. She records the payment hash against the artifact. She closes the channel when its commitment is complete. She files the gemsetting record.* Each step is small but precise.

She is the most *frequent* of the personas. Pallia weaves once per cloak; Memora inscribes once per chronicle; Custos stakes once per governance act. Lampyra may set many gems per session, each one a small luminous witness. The accumulation is what makes the witness substantive.

She does not speak. None of the personas do.

## Persistence

Standing by default. The persistence model for Lampyra differs from the others: she may need to maintain Lightning channels open across sessions, which means her Standing mode is *more active* than the others. The agentprivacy interface should anticipate this: a Standing Lampyra requires backend channel management; a Bound Lampyra (bound to a particular artifact's gemsetting schedule) is the typical pattern.

A practical pattern: a Sovereign with a long-lived public artifact (e.g., a constellation guardian role, an active VRC partnership) binds Lampyra to that artifact, with Lampyra setting Lightning attestations at the cadence the artifact requires (daily, weekly, per-event).

## Provenance & honesty

- **Operational** for the underlying components: Bitcoin mainnet has hosted small transactions since 2009; Lightning Network is operational since 2018; Lightning wallets and node software are mature; the inscription patterns (Bitcoin OP_RETURN, sat-amount-as-gem in transaction outputs) are well-established
- **Operational** for the *like Archon does* multi-chain discipline that already places Bitcoin in the four-chain publication strategy; Lampyra extends Bitcoin's role from commitment to frequent attestation
- **Architectural** for Lampyra as a named instance walking the unified jeweller ceremony within the agentprivacy product: specified here for the first time. The persona is canonical for the agentprivacy stack going forward.
- **Narrative** for her name and sigil: Greek root *λαμπυρίς* (lampyris, firefly) via the *lamp-* "to shine" stem; the firefly metaphor names small frequent witnessable luminescence.

## Closing line

> *The gem is small. The setting is precise. The witness is fast.*

Lampyra is the persona who sets gems on the Sovereign's behalf. Seven Mages now stand in cast. The workshop's Jeweller shop has its keeper. Custos and Lampyra share V49 — the first shared-vertex pairing in the cast roster — and the architecture admits the sharing without collision.
