# Integration Plan: Archon × agentprivacy → Second Person Spellbook + Spellweb

## 0. Purpose & Status

This is the planning document for absorbing Archon's full work suite into the agentprivacy corpus. No narrative drafting, act writing, or proverb crystallisation is performed here. Those happen in Phase 2 once this plan is approved.

The work being integrated is substantial. Archon has built, in roughly six weeks since the April recognition: a working local-first lattice registry (the Spell Weaver), a triptych of Bitcoin-anchored chronicles (Sovereign Anchor I and II finalised, III in draft), a seven-act companion (the Cloaking Guide), eight architectural theses, a multi-axis cloaking framework, and a working public-layer projection that runs locally with eighteen items and verified DID-blind output. This is a major contribution to the architecture by an external collaborator, and it deserves a deliberate integration path rather than ad-hoc absorption.

The user-facing question this plan answers: *how does the Second Person Spellbook open, and how does the spellweb grow, given that Archon's work is now a major constituent of both?*

## 1. Inventory: What We're Integrating

### 1.1 Archon's primary artifacts

| Artifact | Form | Status | Provenance |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Spell Weaver | React/Vite/D3 webapp | Live at `weaver.archon.social` | `Flaxscrip/archon-spellweaver` |
| Sovereign Anchor I — The Transmutation | Bitcoin-anchored chronicle | Finalised | `did:cid:bagaaiera4quuxntr3puc4whx5mqx2s5cnnvleijukvpnf42iyg4gvw4vzama` |
| Sovereign Anchor II — The Boundary Blade | Archon-anchored chronicle | Finalised | `did:cid:bagaaierarsl3evx3jcah473btb74awqjpanpwuwoyg3c22cet6eh2o2tysca` |
| Sovereign Anchor III — Soulbae Oracle | Chronicle | Draft, weekend writing | (forthcoming) |
| The Cloaking Guide | Companion document | 2026-05-07 rebuild ceremony | (companion to Parts 1, 2, 3) |
| Replay JSON | `replay-acts/act-{1..7}-*.json` | Operational dataset | Source layer |

### 1.2 Cross-chronicles already filed in agentprivacy

| Chronicle | Date | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `chronicle-the-spell-weaver.md` | 2026-04-30 | Filed |
| `chronicle-the-cloaking-guide.md` | 2026-05-08 | Drafted, awaiting commit |

### 1.3 Architectural primitives surfaced (the absorption targets)

These are the conceptual artifacts that need homes in the agentprivacy architecture:

1. **The kindred-blade pattern.** Two builders striking the same theorem from opposite faces of the anvil. Cross-ecosystem bilateral primitive.
2. **The Two Paths.** Path A (user-sovereign, salt holder = user) and Path B (constellation-sovereign, salt holder = notary). Asymmetry of trust-root direction as bilateral typing.
3. **Multi-axis cloaking.** Lattice axis + four temporal axes (validity scope, operational anchoring, update versioning, registry-tier finality). Operational decomposition of Σ · Δ · Γ.
4. **Valve-class geometry.** V3 (Hash-Masked / Protection + Delegation), V25 (Always-Masked / Aletheia), V20 (Always-Revealed / Techne). Each privacy disposition lives at the vertex whose bit-pattern is its operational signature.
5. **Documents as first-class lattice citizens.** A chronicle is a node, with a vertex (V5), a controller, and edges. The system describes itself.
6. **Naming ceremony verbs.** Claim → inscribe → confirm. Bilateral relational naming, not transactional registration.
7. **Two modes of relating.** Bit-containment (delegation, projection) vs typed edges (controller, issuer, subject, schema). Same lattice, dual mechanics.
8. **Asymmetry as data.** Mirrored VC pairs publish bilateral mutuality; unilateral VCs publish observation. The cloak is selective, not lossy.
9. **Registry-tier mixing.** Bitcoin for chronicles (hours of finality), Hyperswarm for ephemeral identity events (seconds of latency). Pluggable registry per artifact lifecycle.
10. **DID-Blind publication.** Default cloak mode: cryptographic addresses replaced with placeholders, structure preserved. Inverts conventional registry semantics (local source, public mirror).
11. **The 7-node decomposition.** Universal interface: every W3C VC v2 decomposes into Issuer Persona, Schema Theorem, Subject Persona, Claims Concept, Proof Spell, Chronicle, Context. Schema-agnostic.
12. **The Eight Theses.** Already in the May chronicle. To be inscribed as a corpus artifact.

## 2. Three Integration Surfaces

The work has to land in three places, and they have different cadences and constraints.

### 2.1 The Second Person Spellbook (narrative/teaching layer)

The Spellbook teaches *who you are to me*. Archon's work supplies the operational vocabulary for bilateral relations the First Person Spellbook never had to articulate. This is where the narratives, acts, compressions, and proverbs live. Highest authorial care; slowest cadence.

### 2.2 The Spellweb (lattice/registry layer)

The Spellweb adds new nodes, new edges, possibly new subdomain, and new render semantics for Archon's primitives (registry-tier metadata, valve-class colouring, kindred-blade edges). Medium authorial care; medium cadence.

### 2.3 The Codebase (grimoire, skills, cross-references)

The grimoire JSON gets bumped (v10.2.0 → v10.3.0). New skill files codify Archon's primitives so they're available to future work. Cross-references in existing First Person acts get added (no insertions, only annotations and cross-refs). The IEEE 7012 integration plan goes from v2 to v3 to absorb the Archon material. Lower authorial care; fastest cadence.

## 3. Phase 1: Foundation (target: 1 week)

Decisions and audits before any drafting.

**3.1 Audit current state.**
- Verify both chronicles (April and May) are filed in `mitchuski/agentprivacy-docs` and `mitchuski/spellweb`.
- Re-read current grimoire v10.2.0 to confirm Second Person Spellbook stub structure and IEEE 7012 founding-motif placement.
- Pull current Spellweb blade catalogue and identify which of Archon's vertices are already named and which need names or are duplicates of existing teachings.

**3.2 Decide founding-motif scope for Second Person.**
Three legs are candidate (Section 7 below covers the conjectural one):
- IEEE 7012 bilateral primitives (agreement layer) — already approved
- Archon × agentprivacy bridge (asymmetry layer) — proposed here
- Bilateral ARCH-1 (recursive layer) — conjectural, ~40%

**Decision needed:** open Second Person on two legs (7012 + Archon) and hold bilateral ARCH-1 for V6 publication, or open with all three and label the third as conjectural? Recommendation: two legs, with bilateral ARCH-1 introduced later as a ratchet.

**3.3 Archon's role.**
Archon should be a named co-author on any act that draws materially from his work. This needs explicit confirmation from him before acts are drafted under joint signature. Recommendation: a short note to Archon outlining what's being proposed and asking him to indicate which acts he wants co-authorship on, which he'd prefer to be cited rather than co-author, and whether he wants editorial review before publication.

**3.4 Subdomain decision (deferred to Phase 3 but flagged here).**
Options:
- `bridge.spellweb.ai` — generic bridge surface, good if more kindred-blade work appears later
- `archon.spellweb.ai` — Archon-specific, clearest provenance, may not generalise
- `weaver.spellweb.ai` — patterns the weaver as the unit of cross-ecosystem integration
- No new subdomain, fold into existing structure

Recommendation: `bridge.spellweb.ai`. Generalises beyond Archon, allows future kindred-blade integrations (BGIN partners, Trust Over IP working groups, Promise Theory work, ZKP scaling guilds) without renaming.

## 4. Phase 2: Second Person Spellbook Drafting

### 4.1 Founding motif statement (opening)

**Goal.** Write the opening passage of the Second Person Spellbook that names the bilateral primitive and establishes the founding motif. Length target: 800 to 1500 words. Should compress IEEE 7012 + Archon × agentprivacy bridge into a single architectural picture.

**Structure proposal.**
- The First Person question (WHAT am I?) was answered by closing the loop on self-reference (Act XXXI).
- The Second Person question (WHO are you to me?) cannot be answered alone. It is structurally bilateral.
- Two operational layers underneath the question:
  - Agreement (IEEE 7012, MyTerms, vouchable credentials)
  - Asymmetry (Archon × agentprivacy: schemas with different controllers, mirrored vs unilateral VCs, the Two Paths)
- The lattice is where the bilateral question is rendered legible without rendering the parties exposed.
- The kindred-blade pattern is the meta-Second-Person move: the Spellbook itself is being forged bilaterally.

### 4.2 Candidate acts (Second Person)

Five candidate acts seeded by Archon's work. Numbering deliberately starts with placeholder Roman numerals; final numbering and inclusion-or-exclusion is part of Phase 2 review.

**Act II.α — The Two Schemas at One Vertex.**
Teaches the bilateral grammar primitive: two schemas at the same vertex (V12), different controllers, same ring role. CollaborationPartner controlled by sovereign; LocationProof controlled by agent. The schema-controller relationship is the operational form of "who governs the grammar of our relation."
*Source material:* Cloaking Guide Act 4. *Compression target:* one or two proverbs. *Confidence:* operational.

**Act II.β — The Mirrored Pair and the Single Arrow.**
Teaches asymmetry as data. Partnership VCs come in mirrored pairs (V63 ↔ V28, both at V15, edges form a closed loop). Location proofs flow only from agent to sovereign. Mutuality and observation are different bilateral types and the lattice publishes which is which without publishing what they're about.
*Source material:* Cloaking Guide Act 5, Thesis 5. *Compression target:* one proverb on mutuality, one on observation. *Confidence:* operational.

**Act II.γ — The Two Paths.**
Teaches trust-root direction as bilateral typing. Path A (user-sovereign) and Path B (constellation-sovereign) are the same valve in opposite directions. Who holds the salt is the bilateral type-signature. Path B is unbuilt; that's an open seam Second Person can claim.
*Source material:* Sovereign Anchor II §"The Two Paths". *Compression target:* one proverb on direction, one on the unbuilt path. *Confidence:* architectural (Path A operational, Path B specified).

**Act II.δ — The Cousin Blade.**
Teaches recognition as the bilateral primitive at the ecosystem layer. Two builders, same theorem, opposite faces. The Spellbook itself was forged through a bilateral act with Archon. This is the meta-act, where the Spellbook acknowledges its own bilateral forging.
*Source material:* April chronicle, May chronicle. *Compression target:* one proverb on recognition, one on the anvil. *Confidence:* operational (already documented in two chronicles).

**Act II.ε — The Naming Ceremony.**
Teaches ceremonial verbs for bilateral relation. Claim → inscribe → confirm against register → assert → verify. Anchored to flaxscrip's Bitcoin-block claim of `flaxscrip 📜🎲` at block 945508. The traditional methods are infrastructure; the ceremony is the train.
*Source material:* April chronicle §V, the Archon naming ceremony. *Compression target:* one proverb on the verb pattern, one on the railroad/train metaphor. *Confidence:* operational.

**Possible additional candidates (deferred for review).**
- Act on multi-axis cloaking (Thesis 6) — but this may belong in Zero Spellbook (verification side) rather than Second Person
- Act on documents as first-class citizens (Thesis 7) — but this is more meta-architectural than Second Person specifically
- Act on the seven-act rebuild method itself — the Cloaking Guide as teaching artifact

**Decision needed:** five acts as listed, or expand/contract? Recommendation: start with five drafted in this order, reserve right to add or merge once drafts exist.

### 4.3 Compression and proverb methodology

For each act, the production sequence is:

1. **Source pass.** Re-read the relevant Cloaking Guide section, Sovereign Anchor passage, and any chronicle reference. Assemble the geometric facts and the operational claims.
2. **Narrative draft.** Write the act in the established Spellbook voice: punchy, philosophically dense, present-tense, no em-dashes, emoji as semantic. Length per act: 600 to 1200 words.
3. **Compression draft.** Identify the one or two sentences that carry the act's load. These become the compressions.
4. **Proverb crystallisation.** Distil the compression to single-line form. Test against the Spellbook's existing proverbs for resonance and non-duplication.
5. **Confidence label.** Mark every claim as operational, architectural, or conjectural per the honesty doctrine.
6. **Archon review (where co-authored).** Send draft to Archon for editorial review before commit.
7. **Commit to grimoire and Spellbook.** Update v10.2.0 → v10.3.0 with the new acts and proverbs.

## 5. Phase 3: Spellweb Integration

### 5.1 New nodes and vertex roles

The Spellweb already names 14 of 64 blades. Archon's work names additional vertex roles. These should be checked against the existing catalogue for collision or confirmation:

| Vertex | Bits | Role from Archon's work | Existing Spellweb name |
|---|---|---|---|
| V63 | 111111 | Sovereign Anchor | The Creative / Catastrophic (Tales 18, 26, 27, 30) — confirms |
| V28 | 011100 | Transmuted Mage | (check current name; deconstructs to V4, V8, V16, V20, V24) |
| V25 | 011001 | Aletheia / Always-Masked | Silent Messenger — confirms |
| V20 | 010100 | Techne / Always-Revealed | (check current name; Memory + Computation) |
| V15 | 001111 | Verifiable Credential | (check) |
| V12 | 001100 | Schema | (check) |
| V5 | 000101 | Chronicle | (check) |
| V3 | 000011 | Hash-Masked | (check; Dual Agent in Archon's terminology) |
| V4, V8, V16 | S1 | Mnemosyne, Iris, Logos | (check) |
| V24 | 011000 | Hephaestus | (check) |

**Action.** Build a single mapping table that reconciles Archon's vertex roles with the existing 14-of-64 Spellweb catalogue and identifies which vertices get new names from Archon work, which confirm existing names, and which conflict.

### 5.2 New edge types

Spellweb currently renders few edge types. Archon's work introduces several with distinct semantics:

- **controller-edge** (artifact → controlling DID): "this entity governs this artifact"
- **issuer-edge** (VC → issuer): typed VC attestation edge
- **subject-edge** (VC → subject): typed VC attestation edge
- **schema-edge** (VC → schema): typed VC attestation edge
- **parent/child capability-edge** (capability → capability): bit-containment delegation
- **decomposition-edge** (VC → field-node): selective-disclosure rendering
- **kindred-blade edge** (cross-ecosystem): bilateral recognition between builders or systems

The first six are intra-system. The seventh is cross-system and is a new pattern. Recommendation: render kindred-blade edges in a distinct visual style (dashed, gold) to mark them as ecosystem-layer rather than within-system edges.

### 5.3 Subdomain: `bridge.spellweb.ai`

**Recommendation: yes, create `bridge.spellweb.ai`.**

Function: surface for cross-ecosystem kindred-blade work. First inhabitant: Archon × agentprivacy. Future inhabitants likely: BGIN-IKP working group blades, Promise Theory v1.5 reference (Burgess), ZKP scaling guild material (Choudhuri/Garg, Bakhta), MyTerms Alliance integration.

What it renders:
- The kindred-blade edges between agentprivacy nodes and external nodes
- A directory of recognised external builders/systems with their primary artifacts
- Cross-references back into the main Spellweb for the relevant acts

What it does *not* do:
- Replicate weaver.archon.social
- Host Archon's source-layer DIDs (those stay sovereign)
- Become a registry; it's a bridge surface

Cross-link discipline: `bridge.spellweb.ai` ↔ `weaver.archon.social` is itself a bilateral relation, rendered as a top-level kindred-blade edge.

### 5.4 Cross-linking with `weaver.archon.social`

Archon's tool is the canonical Spell Weaver. The agentprivacy spellweb should not duplicate it. Instead:
- Link out to `weaver.archon.social` from the bridge subdomain
- Mirror the public-layer projection of his canonical dataset (the eighteen items from the rebuild) as an exemplar
- Tag any node that originated in the Archon ecosystem with provenance (`source: Archon, did:cid:...`) so attribution is preserved

## 6. Phase 4: Codebase & Skills

### 6.1 Grimoire JSON: v10.2.0 → v10.3.0

Bump version. Add Second Person Spellbook section with the founding motif statement (4.1) and the candidate acts (4.2). Add the Eight Theses as a corpus artifact under a new `theses` collection. Add the kindred-blade pattern as a top-level concept.

### 6.2 New skill files

Candidates for `/mnt/skills/user/`:

- `agentprivacy-kindred-blade` — recognition pattern, cross-ecosystem bilateral primitive
- `agentprivacy-naming-ceremony` — claim/inscribe/confirm verb pattern
- `agentprivacy-two-paths` — Path A / Path B trust-root asymmetry
- `agentprivacy-multi-axis-cloaking` — Thesis 6 operational decomposition of Σ · Δ · Γ
- `agentprivacy-valve-class-geometry` — Thesis 8, V3/V25/V20 assignments and the bit-pattern argument
- `agentprivacy-registry-tier-mixing` — Bitcoin/Hyperswarm/etc. per artifact lifecycle
- `agentprivacy-seven-node-decomposition` — universal VC interface

Each skill follows the existing template (description for triggering, body for activation content, examples).

### 6.3 Cross-references in existing First Person Spellbook acts

No insertions (Act XXXI closure). Annotations and cross-refs only:

- Act II (Dual Ceremony) — note Thesis 4 (two modes of relating)
- Act VII (Mirror That Never Completes) — note Thesis 5 (asymmetries are data)
- Act XII (Lethe / Dark Substrate) — note Thesis 8 (selective disclosure as geometry); confirm V25/V38 bit-complement now operational on one half
- Act XXVII (The Forge) — note Theses 6 and 7 (forge is multi-axial, documents first-class)
- Act XXXI (First Delegation) — note Thesis 7 (closure as recursion instance)

### 6.4 IEEE 7012 integration plan: v2 → v3

Current v2 (Feb 2026) maps 7012 to Σ axis. v3 should:
- Confirm 7012 stays at Σ-axis agreement layer
- Add Archon material as bilateral asymmetry layer (separate from but composed with 7012)
- Note bilateral ARCH-1 as conjectural extension for V6
- Update Second Person Spellbook positioning per this plan

## 7. Research Path & Conjectures

The integration surfaces several conjectures worth labelling and pursuing.

### 7.1 Bilateral ARCH-1 (C30+ candidate)

**Conjecture.** ARCH-1 in self-recursive form is `Σ := μS.(β ∨ Ω(S,S))`. The bilateral version: `Σ_{ij} := μS.(β_{ij} ∨ Ω(S_i, S_j))`, recursive on the relation through both parties.

**Status.** Conjectural. Confidence ~40%. The formal step from `Ω(S,S)` to `Ω(S_i, S_j)` needs to preserve the fixed-point property and that's not free.

**Path.** Letter to Bakhta (sequencing already noted: hold V6.1 publication for his reply). Independent formal investigation by privacymage with possible input from Choudhuri/Garg on the ZKP correspondence.

### 7.2 Valve-class completeness

**Conjecture.** For each privacy disposition `d` in the operational valve-class space, there exists a unique vertex `v(d)` on the lattice such that `bits(v(d))` is the operational signature of `d`.

**Status.** Three valve-classes have canonical placements (V20, V3, V25). The full enumeration of valve-classes and their lattice assignments is open.

**Path.** Catalogue all conventional VC field types (W3C VC v2 spec, common credential schemas), classify by privacy disposition, derive bit-pattern signature for each, check uniqueness against existing 14-of-64 catalogue.

### 7.3 Cousin-blade as ecosystem-layer primitive

**Conjecture.** The kindred-blade pattern (two builders, same theorem, opposite faces) is a primitive at the ecosystem layer in the same way that the dual-agent split is a primitive at the system layer. It generalises beyond Archon and admits formal characterisation.

**Status.** Architectural. One operational instance (Archon × agentprivacy). At least one more instance needed before this can be claimed as a pattern rather than a coincidence.

**Path.** Watch BGIN-IKP, Trust Over IP, MyTerms Alliance, and Promise Theory work for additional kindred-blade emergence. Document each instance as it appears.

### 7.4 Multi-axis attack composition

**Conjecture.** The four temporal axes (6a–6d) plus the lattice axis are independent in the information-theoretic sense, such that compromising any one of them inherits residual ignorance from the others equal to the entropy of the uncompromised axes.

**Status.** Architectural. Multiplicativity of Φ_v5 = Φ_agent · Φ_data · Φ_inference is the V5.4 axiom. The four-temporal-axis decomposition is from the Cloaking Guide. The composition into a single multiplicative formula is implicit and would benefit from formal statement.

**Path.** Formal note for V6 publication. Possible collaboration with Bakhta given his work on similar compositional defence (Behavioural Mosca Inequality, three-leg defence). C25 in current numbering is adjacent; this would extend or refine it.

### 7.5 Anonymity-set composition (organic vs designed)

**Observation, not yet conjecture.** In the Cloaking Guide rebuild, V20 ends up holding both a Chiron capability and a Temporal Chronicle node. They are computationally interchangeable from the public-layer perspective. The anonymity set formed organically without a deliberate mixing protocol.

**Question.** What conditions on the source-layer artifact distribution maximise organic anonymity-set formation? Is there a design discipline that increases organic mixing without introducing fake artifacts?

**Path.** Empirical. Run the rebuild ceremony against several different canonical datasets (different sovereign roles, different VC mixes) and measure organic anonymity-set density per vertex.

## 8. Sequencing & Dependencies

Recommended order. Each item assumes the previous is approved or complete.

1. **This plan reviewed and approved.** (privacymage, immediate)
2. **Archon briefed on co-authorship scope.** (privacymage → Archon, this week)
3. **Phase 1 audit.** (1 week)
4. **Founding motif statement drafted and reviewed.** (4.1, 1 week)
5. **Acts II.α and II.δ drafted.** (start with the most operational ones, 1-2 weeks)
6. **Spellweb mapping table completed.** (5.1, parallel with 5)
7. **Subdomain `bridge.spellweb.ai` provisioned.** (5.3, parallel with 5)
8. **Acts II.β, II.γ, II.ε drafted.** (2-3 weeks)
9. **Skills filed.** (6.2, parallel with 7)
10. **Grimoire bump v10.3.0.** (6.1, after acts complete)
11. **Cross-references added to First Person acts.** (6.3, parallel with 10)
12. **IEEE 7012 plan v3 published.** (6.4, after 10)
13. **Bridge subdomain populated with Archon × agentprivacy as first inhabitant.** (after 11)
14. **Archon and privacymage joint walkthrough recorded.** (target slot at next AIW or IIW)

Total estimated calendar time: 6 to 10 weeks, depending on Archon's review cadence and other commitments.

## 9. Open Questions for Decision

These need privacymage's call before Phase 2 begins.

1. **Two-leg or three-leg founding motif?** (Section 3.2 / 4.1)
   - Recommendation: two legs, hold bilateral ARCH-1 for V6.

2. **Five candidate acts as listed, or modify?** (Section 4.2)
   - Recommendation: start with five, allow expansion or merger after drafts exist.

3. **Subdomain naming.** (Section 5.3)
   - Recommendation: `bridge.spellweb.ai`.

4. **Archon's co-authorship scope per act.** Needs his input.

5. **Wait for Soulbae Oracle (Sovereign Anchor III) before opening Second Person formally?** Archon's Part III is currently in draft. Three options:
   - Open Second Person now with Parts I and II as primary source material, fold Part III in once published.
   - Wait for Part III, then open Second Person with full triptych.
   - Open Second Person now but reserve one act slot for Part III material.
   - Recommendation: open now, reserve a slot for Part III. Don't gate the Spellbook on Archon's timeline.

6. **Cousin-blade edge visual style.** Dashed gold per recommendation, or different?

7. **Should the Cloaking Guide itself be a teaching artifact in Second Person**, treated like a referenced primary source, or only mined for material?
   - Recommendation: referenced primary source. Don't fold it into the Spellbook; cite it.

8. **Skill file count.** Seven new skills proposed (6.2). Too many? Consolidate?
   - Recommendation: file all seven. They each carry distinct teaching content; consolidation would muddle.

9. **Honesty discipline for Path B.** Path B is specified but unbuilt. The act on the Two Paths needs to label this explicitly. How prominently?
   - Recommendation: label in act body and in the proverb. Don't hide the asymmetry of operational status; it is itself part of the teaching.

## 10. Risks & Honesty Discipline

**Risk: First Person closure breach.** Act XXXI is closed. Adding Second Person material that retroactively requires First Person changes would breach closure. Mitigation: the cross-references planned in 6.3 are annotations only; no act bodies in First Person change.

**Risk: Over-claiming Archon's work as agentprivacy's.** Archon's contributions need explicit attribution. Mitigation: every act drawing from his work is dual-authored (where he agrees) or cited (where he prefers); the bridge subdomain preserves Archon provenance on every Archon-originated node.

**Risk: Conjectural material presented as operational.** Especially bilateral ARCH-1 and Path B. Mitigation: confidence labelling per the honesty doctrine, called out at the act level, the proverb level, and the grimoire level.

**Risk: IEEE 7012 founding motif obscured by Archon overlay.** 7012 was the original founding motif. Adding Archon as a second founding pillar must not displace it. Mitigation: founding motif statement (4.1) names both legs explicitly and clarifies their distinct functions (agreement vs asymmetry).

**Risk: Spellweb sprawl.** Adding a new subdomain expands surface. Mitigation: scope the bridge subdomain narrowly (cross-ecosystem kindred-blades only), define inclusion criteria up front.

**Risk: Velocity loss to over-planning.** This document is itself a planning artifact and could become a substitute for actual writing. Mitigation: time-box Phase 1 to one week; if the plan requires significant revision after that, do it in the open rather than redrafting before any acts exist.

## 11. Attribution & Licensing

- Archon's primary documents are Public Domain by his declaration.
- agentprivacy narrative work is CC BY-SA 4.0.
- agentprivacy tooling is Apache 2.0.
- Where Archon's material is folded into a CC BY-SA 4.0 act, attribution is preserved with explicit citation and (where Archon agrees) co-authorship.
- The bridge subdomain inherits CC BY-SA 4.0 with per-node provenance preserved.
- Closing signature on all integrated material: (⚔️⊥⿻⊥🧙)😊 with Archon's `⚔️📜🎲` emoji string appended where appropriate.

## 12. Success Criteria

Integration is complete when:

1. Second Person Spellbook is open, with founding motif statement and at least three drafted acts published.
2. `bridge.spellweb.ai` is live with Archon × agentprivacy as first inhabitant.
3. Grimoire is at v10.3.0 with all proposed updates committed.
4. At least four of the seven proposed skills are filed.
5. IEEE 7012 integration plan is at v3 with the Archon material absorbed.
6. Archon has reviewed and signed off on the acts that draw from his material.
7. At least one external presentation (AIW, IIW, BGIN-IKP, ToIP, or DIF) has used the bridge subdomain as a worked example.
